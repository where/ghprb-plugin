This plugin builds pull requests from github and reports the results.

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+pull+request+builder+plugin

When a new pull request is opened in the project and the author of the pull
request isn't whitelisted, builder will ask ``Can one of the
admins verify this patch?``. One of the admins can comment ``ok to test``
to accept this pullrequest for testing, ``test this please`` for one time
test run and ``add to whitelist`` to add the author to the whitelist.

If an author of a pull request is whitelisted, adding a new pull
request or new commit to an existing pull request will start a new
build.

A new build can also be started with a comment: ``retest this please``.

### Requirements:
github-api plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+API+Plugin)  
github plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin)
git plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin)  

### Pre-installation:
* I recomend to create GitHub 'bot' user that will be used for communication with GitHub (however you can use your own account if you want).  
* The user needs to have push rights for your repository (must be collaborator (user repo) or must have Push & Pull rights (organization repo)).  
* If you want to use GitHub hooks have them set automatically the user needs to have administrator rights for your repository (must be owner (user repo) or must have Push, Pull & Administrative rights (organization repo))  

### Installation:
* Install the plugin.  
* Go to ``Manage Jenkins`` -> ``Configure System`` -> ``GitHub pull requests builder`` section.
* If you are using Enterprise GitHub set the server api URL in ``GitHub server api URL``. Otherwise leave there ``https://api.github.com``.
* Set your 'bot' user's Access Token.  
  * If you don't have generated your access token you can generate one in ``Advanced...``.  
    * Set your 'bot' user's GitHub username and password.  
    * Press the ``Create Access Token`` button  
    * Copy the generated Access Token into the field ``Access Token``
    * Clear the username and password fields
  * If you don't want to use Access Token leve the field empty and fill the username and password in ``Advanced...``.
* Add GitHub usernames of admins (these usernames will be used as defaults in new jobs).  
* Under Advanced, you can modify:  
  * The phrase for adding users to the whitelist via comment. (Java regexp)  
  * The phrase for accepting a pullrequest for testing. (Java regexp)  
  * The phrase for starting a new build. (Java regexp)  
  * The crontab line. This specify default setting for new jobs.  
* Save to preserve your changes.  

### Creating a job:
* Create a new job.  
* Add the project's GitHub URL to the ``GitHub project`` field (the one you can enter into browser. eg: ``https://github.com/janinko/ghprb``)  
* Select Git SCM.  
* Add your GitHub ``Repository URL``.  
* Under Advanced, set ``refspec`` to ``+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*``.  
* In ``Branch Specifier``, enter ``${sha1}``.  
* Under ``Build Triggers``, check ``GitHub pull requests builder``.
  * Add admins for this specific job.  
  * If you want to use GitHub hooks for automatic testing, read the help for ``Use github hooks for build triggering`` in job configuration. Then you can check the checkbox.
  * In Advanced, you can modify:  
    * The crontab line for this specific job. This schedules polling to GitHub for new changes in Pull Requests.  
    * The whitelisted users for this specific job.  
    * The organisation names whose members are considered whitelisted for this specific job.  
* Save to preserve your changes.  

Make sure you **DON'T** have ``Prune remote branches before build`` advanced option selected, since it will prune the branch created to test this build.

If you want to manually build the job, in the job setting check ``This build is parameterized`` and add string parameter named ``sha1``. When starting build give the ``sha1`` parameter commit id you want to build or refname (eg: ``origin/pr/9/head``).


### Updates

#### -> 1.8
In version 1.8 the GitHub hook url changed from ``http://yourserver.com/jenkins/job/JOBNAME/ghprbhook`` to ``http://yourserver.com/jenkins/ghprbhook``. This shouldn't be noticable in most cases but you can have two webhooks configured in you repository.

#### -> 1.4
When updating to versions 1.4 phrases for retesting on existing pull requsts can stop working. The solution is comment in pull request with ``ok to test`` or remove and create the job. This is caused because there was change in phrases.
